  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:

Fonts:
     - family: Noto_Sans_Math
       fonts:
         -asset: Noto_Sans_Math-Regular.ttf

     - family: Schyler
       fonts:
         - asset: fonts/Schyler-Regular.ttf
         - asset: fonts/Schyler-Italic.ttf
           style: italic
     - family: Trajan Pro
       fonts:
         - asset: fonts/TrajanPro.ttf
         - asset: fonts/TrajanPro_Bold.ttf
           weight: 700
